							<p>Hi, my name is Tătăran Ștefan-George, I was born and raised in Baia Mare, Maramureș, Romania on the 26th of February 2000.</p>
							<p>Ever since a young age I liked to tinker around with computers and electronics, but never knew how to develop this skill. 
							Until in seventh grade when our teacher taught us the basics of C++. That is when I started getting into programming. So I have to thank Mr. Pop Paul Petrica for helping me get into programming. 
							This love for programming was further developed by my late class master, Albu Dumitru.
							</p>
							<p>Besides programming for work and university I also like to create games in Unity and Unreal Engine. This has been a passion of mine ever since 10th grade when I got bored of the games on my PC and 
							found out that by using a game engine like Unity you can create your own games. As time passed I started grasping more advanced concepts and mechanics, but I still have lots to learn. 
							Right now I am tied up with University and work. I hope that after I get my Bachelor's Degree I can get back to creating games in my free time.
							</p>
							<p>Another passion of mine is solving the Rubik's Cube. Everything started in the 7th grade when one of my friends brought his own 3x3x3 Rubik's cube to school and taught me how to solve it in just one school day. 
							After that I started practicing every day when he would bring his cube to school, then as a gift I received my own 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. Short after that I learned how to solve the 2x2x2, 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 Cubes. 
							In the future I would like to start solving other variants of the Rubik's Cube such as: the Mirror Cube, the Gear Cube or the MegaMinx.
							</p>
							<p>As the global pandemic started I also started to cook and I experimented with various recipes. My favorite until now is Quesadilla.</p>
							<p>Another hobby that I love since I started playing games that require grinding is automation. For example in some game, to advance further into the game, you are required to obtain X amount of items. 
							I would get bored pretty easily doing the same task over and over again and I started looking into how I can make my life easier by creating a program that can do that task for me.
							That is how I discovered Python and I started out writing simple bots for games with some success. Pretty soon after discovering Python I found out about Neural Networks and I set a goal for myself: 
							to create a bot that uses a Neural Network. This task wasn't easy for me at the time since I didn't understand any type of Neural Network, but, with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> I created my first 
							Neural Network that can play StarCraft II. Right now I am learning more about Neural Networks since that is a domain that fascinates me.
